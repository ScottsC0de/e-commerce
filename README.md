## <a id="description-id"></a>Description
This project demonstrates the use of Object-Relational Mapping through the technologies Insomnia and Sequelize. We have created a local server with an E-Commerce database. Inside this database is seeded information about Products, their Categories, and their tags. Using the ORM Sequelize, we can perform methods on the data inside this database in our server. These methods include get, post, put, and delete. In our Models folder, we have created SQL table columns that will be put into the database with Sequelize. 

## <a id="installation-id"></a>Installation
To use this application, you must download node onto your local machine. Please visit https://nodejs.org/en/ to install. You will also need VSCode: (https://code.visualstudio.com/download), Insomnia: (https://insomnia.rest), and a copy of my code: (https://github.com/ScottsC0de/e-commerce)

## <a id="usage-id"></a>Usage
With node installed, you can now run node commands on JavaScript files. To use this app, you must be in its file from the CLI or an app that allows you to run CLI commands. For this app, we used VSCodeâ€™s Integrated Terminal. If you are using VSCode, right click on the index.js file and click â€˜Open In Integrated Terminalâ€™. Run a node index.js command to begin creating your ReadMe file. Answer all prompts and watch the magic happen.
